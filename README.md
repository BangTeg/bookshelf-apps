# Bookshelf Apps

## Overview
This project is part of the final submission for the "Belajar Membuat Front-End Web untuk Pemula" course on Dicoding. It is a simple Bookshelf application that allows users to add, edit, and delete books. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface. The application also uses the Web Storage API to store the book data locally in the browser.

## Features

- **Add Book:** Users can add a new book to the bookshelf by providing the title, author, publication year, and completion status.

- **Edit Book:** Users can edit the details of an existing book, including the title, author, publication year, and completion status.

- **Delete Book:** Users can remove a book from the bookshelf.

- **Search Book:** Users can search for a specific book by its title.

- **Separate Bookshelf:** The books are categorized into two sections: "Belum Selesai Dibaca" (Not Yet Finished Reading) and "Selesai Dibaca" (Finished Reading).
